<h2>About Me 🎓 </h2>
<ul>
  <li>When I’m not doing academics, you can find me in a park or yoga studio practicing meditation. I also immerse myself in F1 racing and gaming. During interludes, I cycle, read, explore, and hit the gym. I nerd out hard for anything and everything Star Wars and Marvel, and have recently taken to cooking.</li>
  <li>🖥️ I completed my undergrad at KL University, Hyderabad, with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science. During my sophomore year, I interned at the National Institute of Electronic and Information Technology (NIELIT), an autonomous scientific society within the Govt. of India, where I worked on enterprise-level Android applications. The following year, I interned at Samsung Prism, diving into machine learning and deep learning technologies.</li>
  <li>📚 I’m currently exploring Data Structures & Algorithms, Computational Motor Control, Data Science, Generative AI and Machine Learning.</li>
</ul>🧘‍♂️
